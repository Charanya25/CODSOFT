💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – Task 3

📘 Overview

This project is part of my CODSOFT Data Science Internship (Task 3).
The goal is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model.

🧩 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction features including:

Time
V1–V28 (PCA-transformed features)
Amount
Class (Target: 1 = Fraud, 0 = Legit)

Source: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

🧠 Steps Involved

Handling imbalanced dataset
Splitting data for training & testing
Training a Random Forest classifier
Evaluating using accuracy, precision, recall
Creating a Streamlit dashboard for live predictions

📊 Tools Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Imbalanced-learn (RandomUnderSampler)
Streamlit
Joblib

✅ Results

Fraud Detection Accuracy: ~99% on balanced data
Final prediction labels: Fraud / Legit
Streamlit dashboard for real-time prediction
